# ðŸŽžCINERAMA EMPIRE web-redesign
A re-design of the CINERAMA EMPIRE website (http://www.cinerama-empire.ch/index.html), using basic HTML and Sass.

The idea of this small project was to stick as much as possible to the current website content and layout, but modernizing the style.

The website is **adapted to mobile**ðŸ“² too!


The re-design can be found here, hosted on Netlify :
